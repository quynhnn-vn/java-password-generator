# java-password-generator

This project is a Java Console Application to generate random passwords.

- The user answers with "Y" or "N" to questions about using uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, or symbols.
- The user then enters the desired length of the password.
- A password alphabet is generated based on the user's answers, which is a string containing the chosen characters.
- Random characters from the password alphabet are selected and combined to form a completely random string according to the user's preferences.
- The randomly generated password is then displayed on the console.
